# Tic Tac Toe

I created a Tic Tac Toe Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Tic-tac-toe, noughts, and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper and pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming the best play from both players.
